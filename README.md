# Highschool-Students-MAP-benchmarks
This report presents an in-depth statistical analysis of MAP (Measures of Academic Progress) admission test scores compared with students’ final academic grades. The objective is to evaluate whether the current MAP benchmarks accurately reflect student performance and to identify potential areas for adjustment.

The analysis covers two student groups — those who took MAP tests in Grade 8 and Grade 10 — and compares results across both average scores and individual subject scores in Math and Reading. Linear regression models were used to measure the relationship between MAP, focusing on coefficient interpretation, statistical significance (p-values), and correlation strength (R² values).
